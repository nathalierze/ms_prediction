Prediction Microservice

This python microservice is part of the adaptive learnig as a service architecture to transform the platform orthografietrainer.net towards adaptivity.
It contains a decision tree classifier that is able to predict a user's solution probability when answering capitalization tasks on the platform.
The platform calls the prediction microservice api after each task the user completes to predict the following task solution probability.
